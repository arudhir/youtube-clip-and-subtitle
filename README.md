# CAPSIOmics (Computational Analysis of Proteomics, Transcriptomics, and Phosphoproteomics data for Integrative Omics Clustering)

# Prompt
I want to create a web application using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript where users can upload a CSV with rows as genes and columns as samples, and a metadata table with gene names as indices. The app should provide a dropdown to choose between hierarchical clustering using Spearman or Pearson correlation. The clustered heatmap should be interactive, displaying metadata in a tooltip table on hover. Users should be able to select genes with a rectangular selection and perform gene set enrichment using gseapy or Enrichr, whichever is easier for the app, and two hardcoded pkl files for custom gene sets. The app should display enrichment results in a simple table. NaN values in the input data should be replaced with 0. The app should be deployed on AWS, and the design should be simple, elegant, and modern. I prefer using Flask and Plotly for data processing and visualization. Please provide an example and guidance on building this app using these technologies.

# Answer

To build the web application you described, you can follow these steps:

1. Set up the project environment
2. Configure Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
3. Create a file upload component
4. Process the CSV files and metadata table
5. Implement clustering and heatmap visualization with Plotly
6. Add gene set enrichment analysis
7. Deploy the app on AWS

Here's an example and guidance on building this app using the technologies you mentioned:

Step 1: Set up the project environment

1.1. Install Node.js and npm if you don't have them.

1.2. Create a new Next.js project with TypeScript:

```
npx create-next-app your-app-name --example with-typescript
cd your-app-name
```
Step 2: Configure Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS

2.1. Install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies:

```
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```
2.2. Create a tailwind.config.js file in the project root directory and configure it as needed.

2.3. Import Tailwind CSS in your project's global CSS file, typically found at styles/globals.css.

Step 3: Create a file upload component

3.1. Install the necessary packages for handling file uploads:

```
npm install react-dropzone
```
3.2. Create a file upload component using react-dropzone.

Step 4: Process the CSV files and metadata table

4.1. Install pandas-js for processing CSV data:

```
npm install pandas-js
```
4.2. Use pandas-js to load the CSV files into DataFrames, replace NaN values with 0, and extract the required data.

4.3. Install flask and flask_cors to set up a Flask API for data processing:

```
pip install Flask Flask-CORS
```
4.4. Create a Flask API that receives the CSV data from the frontend and processes it. Make sure to enable CORS for communication between the frontend and the backend.

Step 5: Implement clustering and heatmap visualization with Plotly

5.1. Install plotly.js for creating interactive visualizations:

```
npm install plotly.js
```
5.2. Create a heatmap visualization component that takes the processed data from the Flask API and displays it using Plotly.

5.3. Implement hierarchical clustering using the selected correlation method (Spearman or Pearson). You can use the scipy library in the Flask API for this purpose.

Step 6: Add gene set enrichment analysis

6.1. Install gseapy or use Enrichr's API for gene set enrichment analysis. Choose the one that better suits your needs and implementation.

6.2. Create an endpoint in the Flask API to perform gene set enrichment analysis using the selected genes and custom gene sets.

6.3. Display the enrichment results in a simple table on the frontend.

Step 7: Deploy the app on AWS

7.1. Set up an AWS account and configure the AWS CLI.

7.2. Use AWS Amplify to deploy your Next.js frontend. Follow the official guide for deploying Next.js apps on AWS Amplify.

7.3. Deploy the Flask API using AWS Elastic Beanstalk or AWS Lambda. For Elastic Beanstalk, follow the official guide. For AWS Lambda, you can use the [Serverless framework](https://
